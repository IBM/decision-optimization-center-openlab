**Exercise 3**

**Let’s get familiar with the DoC application.**

This demonstration is built around a simple capacity planning problem. The goal is to plan operational activities using available resources. 

Each activity is characterized by: 

-  A unique ID 
-  Duration in hours 
-  A plant where it happens 

Resources are available to perform the activities but have a limited capacity available at the same time. For example, no more than 15 activities requiring a resource who has the skillset to paint, can be performed at the same time. 

There are some constraints expressed in the form of precedence. To be specific, several activities must be performed prior to others. Finally, the optimization engine has been implemented using CPLEX in order to compute the shortest planning period taking into consideration resource capacities and precedence.

**Main Dashboard Walk-Through**

Once you log into an application you see the following screen with its various features:

![](_attachments/Exercise3-MainDashboard.png)

 -  **Views and Dashboards section** – Under **Views**, you will have access to different tabs to view different tasks. You can see an example Dashboard below.

![](_attachments/Exercise3-Views-Dashboard-section.png)

 -  **New Scenario** – IBM Decision Optimization Center applications provide complete storage of each scenario, including: the input data, scenario parameters, goals, decision variable values, and solution metrics. This is used for performing what-if analysis. 

 -  **Tasks** – These are some actions that need to be performed. There are two ways to execute processing code: 

    -  **As a back-end tasks**: The backend tasks are meant to support short processing. For example, a small data check, a data import or a snapshot export. They run in a shared service amongst all the users of the application.
    -  **Worker tasks**: On the contrary, each worker task is running in a dedicated service on the Optimization Server. Those services are called Worker Services.

 -  **Application Configuration** – This is where we would customize application settings for the user.

**You have completed the following**:
  - Deployed the **Capacity Planning** DOC based application directly from GitHub into your cluster.
  - Used the **Source to Image** strategy provided by OpenShift.

**Start Exercise 3**

1.	Please download the data template from GitHub page. The data template will have several tabs that are input tables for this application. Download this file to **downloads** folder

2.	In the capacity planning application’s homepage, click the **“+”** icon as shown in the figure below. Use an Excel Spreadsheet to create the new scenario

3.	Select the Excel file from the **downloads** folder and name the s cenario example **Base**

4.	Review the application input data
Click on **Data Explorer** Dashboard. To select your scenario as the current scenario. Click on Select a **Scenario** dropdown menu and Select **Base**

![](_attachments/Exercise3-step4.png)

Here you will see the following tables: 
-	**Activity** – List of activities that must be scheduled
-	**Country** – Location of plants
-	**Issues** – This table is related to error found during data quality check
-	**Plant** – It is location where the activities are being performed
-	**Precedence** – Activities that needed to be complete before 
-	**Requirement** – Number of resources required for each activity
-	**Resource** – List of available resources
-	**Resource Capacity** – Available capacity by resource
-	**Resource Usage Per Day** - Table computed by optimization engine
-	**Schedule** – Table computed by optimization engine
-	**Solution Summary** - Table computed from solution tables

5.	Use dedicated dashboards for a better understanding on data. Click the **Workloads** dashboard.

6.	Using the Check Boxes, randomly select few activity IDs located on the Activity table on the right side. Once selected, you will notice that activities have been added to the Predecessor(s) and Successor(s) columns. This will tell us which activities need to be completed first. The chart below shows a bar chart of locations and number of hours required to complete the activities. Click Select **Plant** cell and type **London**, **Nice**.

The purpose of creating the Workload dashboard is to for business analyst to get some insight of activities that need to be performed, workload skills required in hours at a plant level.

7.	The business analyst can look at the capacity for each plant. The capacity dashboard gives the details on headcount required by skills to complete all the activities.

8.	Click **Data Issues** to navigate to the Data Checker dashboard. This dashboard is to check if there are any discrepancies in the input data. It checks for inconsistencies in data.

9.	On the Data Issues Click **Run Checker** to start the checker; this will take you to the screen below. Once there, click **Run**

10.	Once the checker task is complete. It shows the errors, warnings and explain that those messages are generated by a data checker that is customized for all projects

11.	If there are zero errors, then Click the Run Engine view and click Run Engine button on the top

12.	Click **Gantt** button to navigate to Gantt chart schedule dashboard with optimized schedule, KPI’s for time span and visual representation of solution in terms of bar and Gantt Chart. Click **Pivot Table** button on the top to review the solution further in details.

This is end of exercise 3. To summarize you have completed the following steps:
-	Overview of the capacity planning application
-	Created a new scenario and reviewed data inputs that are required to come up with a plan on assigning resources to activities
-	Use of optimization engine to compute optimized schedule 
-	Review the solution using Gantt and Pivot table dashboards
