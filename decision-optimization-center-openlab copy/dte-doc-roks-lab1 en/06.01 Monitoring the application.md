Exercise 5
Perform What if Analysis

The Scenario Management Service is a predefined service that you can configure for DOC based application and no customization is required.

In this exercise we create a scenario to analyze the impact of having less resources of a given type on the plan.

1.	Go to the home page of the application. Click Home on view pane on left-hand side.

2.	In the New Workspace section Scenario section of the page you will see base scenario that
we created in exercise3. Click on (…) of Base scenario and duplicate the scenario.

8.	Click **Gantt Schedule** and **Pivot Table** under the views pane on left-hand side to review the solution. You should now see an extended schedule. You can change your current scenario to see the differences using the scenario selector. You can see that when we reduced the headcount of M1 and M2 resources to 10 the total time needed to complete the schedule jumped to 133 days.
