**Exercise 1**

In this exercise, learn how to access the IBM Cloud portal and the OpenShift web console. An OpenShift cluster has already been provisioned and temporarily assigned to you as part of the lab provisioning process.

**Note:** The sample output shown in the lab guide may be slightly different than what you see in the output when you issue the commands for your cluster.

**Access the OpenShift web console**

1. Launch the IBM Cloud portal: <a href="##OPENSHIFT.overviewUrl##" target="_blank">##OPENSHIFT.overviewUrl##</a>.

**Note:** The IBM Cloud Portal and  OpenShift web console will be opened in a new browser tab. You need to switch between this tab and the new tabs to accomplish many of the lab tasks. You may want to open the new tabs in new windows and display both browser windows at the same time. You may need to disable pop-up blockers if you do not see the new tabs.

2. On the IBM Cloud portal page, notice details about the OpenShift cluster that has been provisioned, including:

  - Number of Worker Nodes and their status (you should see two worker nodes in a "normal" state)
  - Links to manage worker nodes and worker pools
  - Link to open the "OpenShift web console"

**Note**: In this lab enviroment, your IBM Cloud User ID has been given limited permissions in an IBM Demos account. While you can explore these options in the IBM Cloud portal, you will not be able to add, remove, or modify worker nodes or pools. To learn more about these processes, check out the videos and product tours here: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/demos/collection/Red-Hat-OpenShift-on-IBM-Cloud/" target="_blank">Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud Demos</a>.

3. Next, explore the **OpenShift web console**.

4. In the OpenShift web console, notice the following:

  - The different perspectives available in the OpenShift web console: Administrator and Developer
  - Capabilities of each perspective and dashboards available for each
  
5. Take a few minutes to explore the OpenShift web console.  Try finding the following:

  - Number of nodes in the cluster inventory dashboard
  - Standard services deployed in the default project
  - Operators installed
